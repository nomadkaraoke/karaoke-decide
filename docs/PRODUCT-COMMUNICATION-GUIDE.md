# Product Communication Guide

Guidelines for how to communicate about Nomad Karaoke to users, in marketing materials, UI copy, and support interactions.

## Core Principles

1. **Transparency over hype** - Set realistic expectations so users aren't surprised
2. **Avoid AI terminology** - "AI" has become a loaded term; say "our system" or "the tool" instead
3. **Acknowledge user effort** - The human review step is required, not optional
4. **Highlight real differentiators** - Real instrumentals (not covers), precise sync, multiple formats

## Key Facts to Communicate Accurately

### Timing
- **Accurate:** "Create a karaoke video in under 30 minutes"
- **Avoid:** "in minutes" (implies much faster than reality)
- Typical flow: ~20-30 minutes including human review

### Song Availability
- **Accurate:** "Any song" - this IS true
- Users can: search by artist/title, paste YouTube URL, or upload their own audio
- If users can get the audio from somewhere, we can make karaoke from it

### Lyrics Sync Quality
- **Accurate:** "Precise lyrics sync" - the timing/sync IS very accurate
- The sync (when words appear) is reliable and handled automatically
- The challenge is lyrics ACCURACY (correct words), not timing

### Human Review Requirement
- **Be clear:** Users ALWAYS need to review the transcribed lyrics
- For songs with clear vocals (country, ballads): few or no corrections needed
- For complex songs: expect 5-10 minutes of corrections
- Frame as "Review & Correct" not "Preview and fine-tune" (the latter sounds optional)

### Audio Separation
- **Accurate:** "Real instrumentals from the original song"
- **Avoid:** "Studio-quality separation" (oversells it)
- Key differentiator: NOT a cover band or MIDI recreation - it's the actual song
- Separation quality is very good but not perfect for all songs

### Backing Vocals Option
- Users can choose between:
  - Clean instrumental (all vocals removed)
  - Instrumental with backing vocals preserved
- This matters for songs with backing vocals; irrelevant for songs without

### Output Formats
- 4K MP4 karaoke video (main output)
- "With Vocals" version for sing-along practice
- CDG+MP3 ZIP for older/commercial karaoke systems
- All videos published to Nomad Karaoke YouTube channel (not user's channel)

### YouTube Integration
- **Accurate:** Videos are published to the Nomad Karaoke YouTube channel
- **Wrong:** "Upload to your YouTube channel" - we don't do this
- This is for easy sharing, not user channel integration
